This example shows how to change default VCS setting behavior
By default, if `vcs_repo` variable is set, VCS is enabled across all the workspaces
In case if it needs to be customized, there are two options:
 - set `vcs_repo_enable` to `false` to not enable VCS at all
 - set `vcs_repo` within particular workspace to enable VCS with custom settings (e.g. repository, branch, token etc.)
